## Objective:
Implement a simple backend for a shopping cart service. The consumer of your service should
be able to make an API call to add items to the cart as well as view items in the cart. Adding to
the shopping cart should require an object with the attributes Name, Price, and Quantity (you
can set the values to whatever you like).
Please use C#, Java, or Python for your solution.
Ensure that the overall quality of your code is production-ready and that it adheres to best
practices for maintainability and readability.

## Deliverables:
Push your solution to a public GitHub repository and send the link to talent acquisition no longer
than 1 week after receiving this coding challenge.
